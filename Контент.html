    <section class="chapter"><h2 class="chapter__heading">1. Photos tells us about the most important thing for us</h2>
        <p class="chapter__paragraph"> If you ask someone what exactly of his things he will save in a critical situation, then most likely they will answer you: a photo album or a computer hard drive on which family photos are recorded in digital form. In case of panic, a person always grabs the most precious thing for him. And most often it's not money, not jewelry, but photos of loved ones, pictures that hold a piece of the past, a piece of the days of life that have already passed.</p>

        <p class="chapter__paragraph"> By photographing, we document our lives. We capture the most important, most significant moments of it. Weddings and anniversaries, the birth of children, housewarming, holidays in distant cities and countries… All this is of great importance to us. These photos are our history, the history of our family. In these frames, each of us is captured in different years of life. A very young grandmother, even before the war, in a beautiful polka dot dress – and now she is already in old age: wrinkles, kind eyes…</p>
        
        <p class= "chapter__paragraph"> Hundreds, thousands of frames add up bit by bit into the life story of each of us.</p>

    <section class="chapter"><h2 class = "chapter__heading"> 2. Photography is a piece of human heritage </h2>
        <p class="chapter__paragraph"> Surely every person, at least living in the USSR, and then in Russia, for sure, took part in group photography. For example, at school. Remember: we, still children, were lined up in three or four rows, teachers and the school principal were standing or sitting in the center… We then posed motionlessly, sometimes we felt constrained. After all, at that second we didn't even think about the fact that looking into the camera lens, we were looking into eternity! But these school photos will outlive us… After many years, and maybe many decades, somewhere in the attic or in the closet of the old one, among a pile of yellowed papers, our children or grandchildren will find these photos and recognize their ancestors on them. They will see their dads and moms, grandparents very young. The significance of these photos is very, very great for each of us. After all, they reflected a stopped moment of a past life. No wonder they say: "stop, a moment, you're fine!".</p>
        
        <p class="chapter__paragraph"> Family photos are pieces of our life…</p>

    <section class="chapter"><h2 class = "chapter__heading"> 3. Photos help us communicate </h2>
        <p class="chapter__paragraph"> A photographic image is much more significant, much more serious than just a picture. Photography touches the most secret, the deepest that is in our soul, the best, kindest, most generous sides of human nature. Photography always makes us want to share with others what we consider important, interesting, the most important.</p>
        
        <p class="chapter__paragraph"> There are many sites on the Internet now where people share their photos. These photos are very diverse: sometimes they are very personal, emotional: passionate, sad… Sometimes they are bizarre and funny, sometimes they display some interesting places, interesting people…With the help of such photos, we share with other people our impressions of what we are going through.</p>

    <section class="chapter"><h2 class = "chapter__heading"> 4. In each of us, photography reveals the artist </h2>
        <p class="chapter__paragraph"> Photography has become technically accessible today, which gives us a great opportunity for our own self-expression. Self-expression through visual art. Many of us, picking up a camera, begin to notice how cute and clean the faces of children are, how wise the eyes of old people are, how beautiful the expanses of nature surrounding us are, how impressive the colors of golden autumn impress our consciousness ... I immediately want to start creating beautiful photographic paintings. At such moments we begin to feel like creators, artists.</p>

    <section class="chapter"><h2 class = "chapter__heading"> 5. Photography is a very complex language </h2>
        <p class="chapter__paragraph"> Through photography, its author can express the whole palette of human feelings. Surprise, empathy, joy, sadness, sadness, tenderness… A lot of human emotions can be reflected in one frame. For example, not everyone will appreciate the landscape that was photographed on a cloudy day. They want to see the surrounding nature joyful, in a riot of many colors, and not gray and sad. But after all, if there are no bright and saturated colors in the landscape, this does not mean that life has gone out of it! It's just that life is different in this landscape: quiet and calm, slowly flowing.. And if you take a picture of a storm, a thunderstorm… That's where you can see the power of nature, its power!</p>
        
        <p class="chapter__paragraph"> If one of your loved ones suddenly has a sad mood - show him bright and sunny photos! And the person's mood will immediately rise noticeably!</p>
        <p class="chapter__paragraph"> Photography allows us to express what sometimes cannot be expressed simply in words when our vocabulary runs out. Photography speaks to us in its own visual language.</p>

    <section class="chapter"><h2 class = "chapter__heading"> 6. Photography changes us</h2>
        <p class="chapter__paragraph">A photographic image always attracts the attention of a person. It appeals directly to his emotions. Look, for example, at military photographs, or at pictures taken at moments of tragedies, natural disasters. One such image, one person's eyes crying out for help can say so much… It works on a more subtle level, at the level of our subconscious. Grief, misfortune, tragedy can wash away everything colorful and beautiful from our lives. There is not and cannot be a way to restore color, light and joy in such photos. Such photos change our consciousness. There is no need to look for colors in this flashy black and white. But this severity and the truth of life, nevertheless, can lead us to color. To the light in life.</p>

        <p class="chapter__paragraph">In moments of grief, a photographic image can revive our hope for a wonderful future. For the future, in which both color and light will appear.</p>
